# Case 4 - Which neighbourhoods get a smoke or hail flag?

**Stream:** Software and Computational Math

## The problem (in plain words)

Bad weather is not the same in every neighbourhood. The **5 August 2024** hailstorm was about **$3.3 billion** and **~130,000** insurance claims - mostly a north / airport corridor, not “the whole city.” Smoke is the other flag: a few stations measure air, and someone still has to say **which communities** get a notice.

There is no public hail-claims spreadsheet by neighbourhood. The hail column in this pack is a **practice label** from news about that storm path, not insurance data.

**Your challenge:** Flag neighbourhoods for **smoke**, **hail**, or both. Beat a lazy rule (downtown only, or “city average is smoky → flag everyone”). Then change the air cutoff or the hail weight and show which communities flip.

## Who would use this

Emergency Management, 311, or a school-board ops lead. You are selling a **short flagged list** when risk is not city-wide.

---

## Steps

1. Load air readings and the neighbourhood table. Use AQHI and/or fine particles (PM2.5).
2. Give each community the **nearest station** (straight-line km is enough).
3. Combine air score with `hail_track` (`high` / `medium` / `low`). Write the flag rule in one line.
4. Compare to downtown-only or “flag everyone if the city mean is high.”
5. Change the cutoff; count flips. Ten lines a supervisor could read.

## Picture of the loop

```mermaid

  A[Load air + neighbourhoods] --> B[Nearest station]
  B --> C[Flag vs downtown or city-mean]
  C --> D[Change cutoff]
  D --> C
```

**AQHI** is Canada’s Air Quality Health Index (roughly 1 = low risk, 7+ = high). A station is a sensor, not a neighbourhood.

## New words

| Word | Meaning |
|---|---|
| AQHI | Air Quality Health Index |
| PM2.5 | Tiny particles in smoke and exhaust |
| Hail track | In this lab: high / medium / low along the Aug 2024 north-city path (a scenario, not insurance data) |

## Start here

1. Open a terminal **in this folder**.
2. `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. `python agent_starter.py`
4. Change the AQHI cutoff and run it again.

Data notes: [`data/README.md`](data/README.md). **Python 3.10+** (3.11 is best).

## Web app

The Next.js + Supabase app lives in [`web/`](web/README.md), independently of the
Python starter. Use Node.js 22.13+:

```powershell
cd web
npm install
npm run dev
```

Add your Supabase project URL and publishable key to `web/.env.local`, then
restart the server. Full setup and validation instructions: [`web/README.md`](web/README.md).
