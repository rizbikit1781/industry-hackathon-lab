# Data Guide - Neighbourhood Smoke and Hail Flags (Case 4)

Two small tables are already in this folder.

## Bundled seeds

| File | What it is |
|---|---|
| `calgary_air_quality_seed.csv` | Open Calgary near-real-time readings for **Air Quality Health Index** and **Fine Particulate Matter** (three Calgary stations) |
| `neighbourhoods_hail_scenario.csv` | Community centroids plus a `hail_track` band for an **Aug 2024-style** north-Calgary hail path |

`hail_track` values: `high` (named in public coverage of the 5 Aug 2024 north / airport corridor), `medium` (adjacent north / northeast / inner-north), `low` (sample of the rest of the city).

This is **not** a CatIQ claims file and **not** an official City hail map. Treat it as a labelled scenario so you can combine smoke and hail in one flag.

Community centroids are vertex averages of Open Calgary community polygons, good enough for nearest-station assignment.
